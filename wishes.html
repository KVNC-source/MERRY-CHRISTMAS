              Dearest Ica, I wanted to take a moment to write down everything I
              wish for you this holiday season and in the year to come...
            </p>

            <p>
              I hope you know how much your "nonstop yapping" truly means to me.
              It’s the soundtrack to all my days, and I wish for a thousand more
              hours of listening to you talk about everything and nothing.
            </p>

            <p>
              May your days be filled with the scent of lilies and the sweetness
              of the jellies and chocolates you love. But more than that, I wish
              for you to always see yourself and stay the sweet angel who makes
              the world a lot brighter just by being in it. May God bless you
              abundantly and keep you safe always. Through all your struggles
              and triumphs, may you always find strength in knowing how deeply
              you are loved and looked out for. You are the strongest person I
              know, and I wish for you to always believe in yourself as much as
              I believe in you.
            </p>

            <p>
              Merry Christmas, Ica. I meant every word that i wrote on those
              lilies.
